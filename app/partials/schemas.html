    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The most visible part of forms-angular is the <strong>form-input</strong> directive which
        takes a <em>schema</em> in the scope and creates inputs. These schemas can be very simple as in the
        example below:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;div ng-init="name=[
    {id:'f_surname',label:'Surname',name:'surname',type:'text'},
    {id:'f_forename',label:'Forename',name:'forename',type:'text'}
    ]"&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;form-input schema="name" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div&gt;</pre>
    <p>This simple bit of markup creates a small schema and stores it in the $scope as <em>name</em>(you
        wouldn't normally it like this, but it illustrates things well)
        then in a form invokes the form-input directive, telling it to use the schema just created.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately displaying the resulting form stops the page scrolling to the internal links, so we have
        decided to
        omit it - there are plenty of examples accessible elsewhere on the site.</p>

<section id="mongoose" name="Mongoose Schemas" affix-scroll>
    <h3>Mongoose Schemas</h3>

    <p>Mongoose is a popular package that simplifies using MongoDB with Node JS. Mongoose requires that
        a schema is created for each 'model'. As you will have seen in the <a href="/#/get-started">Get
            Started</a> section, <strong>forms-angular</strong> can convert Mongoose schemas into the schemas
        that
        the form-input directive uses, which saves a lot of coding by hand and makes it very easy to
        keep your front and back ends in sync.</p>

    <p>As many models as you want can be registered with forms-angular by calling the <code>addResource</code>
        method of the forms-angular object as <a href="/#/get-started#server-code">shown</a> in the
        Get Started section. If you have more than a few models it is a good idea to put them in their own
        directory and loop through it.</p>

    <p>A trivially simple schema looks like this:</p>
            <pre>var ApplicantSchema = new Schema({
    surname: {type:String, required:true, index:true},
    forename: {type:String, index:true},
});</pre>
    <p>Each schema element (or field) has a type and optionally a number of other properties. Many of these
        properties
        are used by forms-angular to generate appropriate behaviour on the front end. The appropriate input
        types are
        used, and client side validation keeps round trips down (we cannot say "to a minimum" as work remains to
        be done in this area).</p>

    <p>You can get an idea of what forms-angular does with a vanilla Mongoose JS schema by looking at <a
            href="/code/a_unadorned_mongoose.js">this schema</a> and <a href="/#/a_unadorned_mongoose/new">the
        form generated from it</a>.</p>

            href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html">Mongoose JS website</a>.</p>

<section id="list-fields" name="List Fields" affix-scroll>
    <h3>List Fields</h3>

    <p>In a couple of places forms-angular uses the concept of 'list fields' - fields that generally allow
        the user to quickly see
        what they are dealing with - for example in the case of a person the forename and surname would be
        list fields. They don't
        have to be unique, they just have to be useful. List fields are used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When populating select options when a model is referenced by another model</li>
        <li>In list forms - where the contents of a collection are displayed</li>
        <li>In search results (though this can be overridden)</li>
        <li>In reports when a model is referenced by another model and a columnTranslation is used</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A field may be specified to be a list field by adding a truthy value for a <strong>list</strong> key
        in the schema element: <code>forename: {type:String, list:true}</code></p>

    <p>List fields can be generated on both the front and back end, and it is done as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If there is at least one schema element with a truthy value for <strong>list</strong> then all
            such fields are list fields
        </li>
        <li>If no field is specified as a list field then:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>On the client the first non hidden string field is used or failing that the first field</li>
            <li>On the server the first two fields are used (one day there will hopefully be some
                consistency here!)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

<section id="form-object" name="The form Object" affix-scroll>
    <h3>The <em>form</em> Object</h3>

    <p>The mark-up of generated forms can be influenced by use of the <strong>form</strong> object in the
        schema type: <code>surname: {type:String, form:{label:'Family Name', size:'large'}}</code></p>

    <p>The form object can have the following keys:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>hidden</strong> inhibits this schema key from appearing on the generated form.</li>
        <li><strong>label</strong> overrides the default input label. label:null suppresses the label
            altogether.
        </li>
        <li><strong>placeHolder</strong> adds placeholder text to the input (depending on data type).</li>
        <li><strong>help</strong> adds help text under the input.</li>
        <li><strong>helpInline</strong> adds help to the right of the input.</li>
        <li><strong>size</strong> sets <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/base-css.html#forms">control
            width</a>.
            Options are: mini, small, medium (default), large, xlarge, xxlarge and block-level.
        </li>
        <li><strong>directive</strong> allows you to specify custom behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>readonly</strong> adds the readonly attribute to the generated input (doesn't work with
            date - and perhaps other types). </li>
        <li><strong>select2</strong> in an enum field or a reference field tells the system to use the
            <a href="http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/"><em>select2</em></a> control rather than a
            <em>select</em>. If the number of options is large in a reference field then
            <strong>select2:{fngAjax:true}</strong> instructs the program to use ajax calls to query
            the server rather than downloading the table. The values in the select2 control come
            from the <a href="#listing">listing fields</a>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>rows</strong> sets the number of rows in inputs (such as textarea) that support this.
            Setting rows
            to
            <strong>"auto"</strong> makes the textarea expand to fit the content, rather than create a
            scrollbar.
        <li><strong>pane</strong> used to divide a large form up into panes accessed by tabs
            (see <a href="/#/i_tabbed_forms/new">example</a>). This requires using the UI Bootstrap tabs
            module which
            is not in the minimal deployment folder (but is in this demo).
            <!--TODO: Check that statement -->
        </li>
        <li><strong>noAdd</strong> inhibits an Add button being generated for arrays.</li>
        <li><strong>noRemove</strong> inhibits a Remove button being generated for array elements.</li>
        <li><strong>add</strong> allows arbitrary attributes to be added to the input tag. Useful for adding
            classes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>formstyle</strong> (only valid on a sub schema) sets style of sub form. See <a
                href='/#/forms#form-styles'>form style section</a> for options.
        </li>
        <li><strong>link</strong> sets up hyperlinks for reference fields as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><em>linkOnly</em> if true (which at the time of writing is the only option supported)
                    then the input
                    element is not generated.
                </li>
                <li><em>text</em> the text used for the link.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="/code/b_using_options.js">This example schema</a> and <a href="/#/b_using_options/new">this
        form</a> shows many of these options in use.</p>

<section id="containers" name="Containers" affix-scroll>
    <h3>Containers</h3>

    <p>Sometimes it is hard within a Mongoose schema to detail exactly how you want the associated form
        or forms to be laid out. One particular class of layout features that currently cannot be
        requested within a Mongoose schema are containers. Hopefully this will be addressed in a forthcoming
        release
        but if you need them now then you need to create a schema by hand (or dynamically in code).</p>

    <p>An example of a use of containers would be:</p>
    <pre>
&ltform-input ng-init="names=[
  {containerType:'fieldset',title:'Name',content:
    [
      {id:'f_surname',label:'Surname',name:'surname',type:'text'},
      {id:'f_forename',label:'forename',name:'forename',type:'text'}
    ]
  }
]" schema="names"&gt&lt/form-input&gt</pre>
    <p>Other containers are <strong>tab</strong>,
        <strong>well</strong>, <strong>well-large</strong> and <strong>well-small</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you want to &quot;roll your own&quot; you can do something like:</p>
    <pre>
&ltstyle&gt
  .redBorder {border:solid 2px red;}
  p.bigRed {color: red; font-size: large}
&lt/style&gt
&ltform-input ng-init="names=[
  {containerType:'redBorder',title:'Name',titleTagOrClass:'bigRed',content:
    [
      {id:'f_surname',label:'Surname',name:'surname',type:'text'},
      {id:'f_forename',label:'forename',name:'forename',type:'text'}
    ]
  }
]" schema="names"&gt&lt/form-input&gt
</pre>
    <p>Where container type is seen as a class for a div and a titleTagOrClass of h1..h6 is interpreted as a
        heading tag and anything else as a class to be applied to a paragraph (as in the example).  If a title is
        specified without a corresponding titleTagOrClass then &lt;h4&gt; is used as a default.</p>
</section>

<section id="custom" name="Custom Schemas" affix-scroll>
    <h3>Custom Schemas</h3>

    <p>It is easy to create custom form schemas which are a subset of the whole schema by specifying the
        fields to include and any options. See the static in <a href="/code/b_using_options.js">this example</a>.
        The custom form schemas are invoked as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>/#/:model/:formschema</strong> (<a href="/#/b_using_options/justnameandpostcode/">example
            here</a>)
        </li>
        <li><strong>/#/:model/:formschema/new</strong> (<a
                href="/#/b_using_options/justnameandpostcode/new">example
            here</a>)
        </li>
        <li><strong>/#/:model/:formschema/:id/edit</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Subkeys</h4>
<p>Custom schemas are a good way to allow access to only part of a document, for instance if a customer record contained operational
    and accounts information an accounts user would require a different view of the data (that would include account balance)
    than a user from operations (who would not have access to the account balance).  Consider the following:</p>
    <pre><code>var AddressSchema = new Schema({
    type: { type: String, default: 'Home', enum: ['Delivery', 'Invoice', 'Historic'] },
    street: String,
    town: String,
    postalCode: String
    }, {_id: false});</code></pre>
    <p>and in the customer model</p>
    <pre><code>addressList: {type: [AddressSchema], mergeKey: 'type', form: {pane: 'Address', labels: 'Addresses'}}</code></pre>
    <p>We need a way of having the delivery address appear on one form (for the operation user) and the invoice address on the
    finance form, even though they are in the same field.</p>
    <p>forms-angular has the concept of a <strong>subkey</strong> for this scenario.  The custom schema for the operations user would contain:</p>
    <pre><code>addressList: {subkey: {keyList: {type: 'Delivery'}, containerType: 'well-small', title: 'Address', titleTagOrClass: 'h5'}}</code></pre>
    <p>while that for finance might include</p>
    <pre><code>addressList: {subkey:
    [
        {keyList: {type: 'Invoice'}, containerType: 'well-small', title: 'Invoice To:'},
        {keyList: {type: 'Delivery'}, containerType: 'well-small', title: 'Deliver To:'}
    ]
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that subkey can be an object or an array of objects.  Where there are multiple sub docs that match the subkey the first will be used.</p>
